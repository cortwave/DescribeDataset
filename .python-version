3.9.18

Using this repo I want to describe dataset as text to use it later with LLM to help LLM to understand my dataset structure. Now if folder contains more than N files it shows only first 3 files. I want to add amount of files containing in the folder near to the folder name and obviously mention that here only 3 examples of files
